Babel Changelog
===============

Version 3.0
-----------

(release date to be decided; codename to be picked)

- Upgraded data to CLDR 26
- Add official support for Python 3.4

Version 2.0
-----------

(Released on July 27th 2015, codename Second Coming)

- Added support for looking up currencies that belong to a territory
  through the :func:`babel.numbers.get_territory_currencies`
  function.
- Improved Python 3 support.
- Fixed some broken tests for timezone behavior.
- Improved various smaller things for dealing with dates.

Version 1.4
-----------

(bugfix release, release date to be decided)

- Fixed a bug that caused deprecated territory codes not being
  converted properly by the subtag resolving.  This for instance
  showed up when trying to use ``und_UK`` as a language code
  which now properly resolves to ``en_GB``.
- Fixed a bug that made it impossible to import the CLDR data
  from scratch on windows systems.

Version 1.3
-----------

(bugfix release, released on July 29th 2013)

- Fixed a bug in likely-subtag resolving for some common locales.
  This primarily makes ``zh_CN`` work again which was broken
  due to how it was defined in the likely subtags combined with
  our broken resolving.  This fixes :gh:`37`.
- Fixed a bug that caused pybabel to break when writing to stdout
  on Python 3.
- Removed a stray print that was causing issues when writing to
  stdout for message catalogs.

Version 1.2
-----------

(bugfix release, released on July 27th 2013)

- Included all tests in the tarball.  Previously the include
  skipped past recursive folders.
- Changed how tests are invoked and added separate standalone
  test command.  This simplifies testing of the package for
  linux distributors.

Version 1.1
-----------

(bugfix release, released on July 27th 2013)

- added dummy version requirements for pytz so that it installs
  on pip 1.4.
- Included tests in the tarball.

Version 0.9.5
-------------

(relased on April 6th 2010)

- Fixed the case where messages containing square brackets would break with
  an unpack error.
- Backport of r467: Fuzzy matching regarding plurals should *NOT* be checked
  against len(message.id)  because this is always 2, instead, it's should be
  checked against catalog.num_plurals (:trac:`212`).


Version 0.9.4
-------------

(released on August 25th 2008)

- Currency symbol definitions that is defined with choice patterns in the
  CLDR data are no longer imported, so the symbol code will be used instead.
- Fixed quarter support in date formatting.
- Fixed a serious memory leak that was introduces by the support for CLDR
  aliases in 0.9.3 (:trac:`128`).
- Locale modifiers such as "@euro" are now stripped from locale identifiers
  when parsing (:trac:`136`).
- The system locales "C" and "POSIX" are now treated as aliases for
  "en_US_POSIX", for which the CLDR provides the appropriate data. Thanks to
  Manlio Perillo for the suggestion.
- Fixed JavaScript extraction for regular expression literals (:trac:`138`)
  and concatenated strings.
- The `Translation` class in `babel.support` can now manage catalogs with
  different message domains, and exposes the family of `d*gettext` functions
  (:trac:`137`).


Version 0.9.3
-------------

(released on July 9th 2008)

- Fixed invalid message extraction methods causing an UnboundLocalError.
- Extraction method specification can now use a dot instead of the colon to
  separate module and function name (:trac:`105`).
- Fixed message catalog compilation for locales with more than two plural
  forms (:trac:`95`).
- Fixed compilation of message catalogs for locales with more than two plural
  forms where the translations were empty (:trac:`97`).
- The stripping of the comment tags in comments is optional now and
  is done for each line in a comment.
- Added a JavaScript message extractor.
- Updated to CLDR 1.6.
- Fixed timezone calculations when formatting datetime and time values.
- Added a `get_plural` function into the plurals module that returns the
  correct plural forms for a locale as tuple.
- Added support for alias definitions in the CLDR data files, meaning that
  the chance for items missing in certain locales should be greatly reduced
  (:trac:`68`).


Version 0.9.2
-------------

(released on February 4th 2008)

- Fixed catalogs' charset values not being recognized (:trac:`66`).
- Numerous improvements to the default plural forms.
- Fixed fuzzy matching when updating message catalogs (:trac:`82`).
- Fixed bug in catalog updating, that in some cases pulled in translations
  from different catalogs based on the same template.
- Location lines in PO files do no longer get wrapped at hyphens in file
  names (:trac:`79`).
- Fixed division by zero error in catalog compilation on empty catalogs
  (:trac:`60`).


Version 0.9.1
-------------

(released on September 7th 2007)

- Fixed catalog updating when a message is merged that was previously simple
  but now has a plural form, for example by moving from `gettext` to
  `ngettext`, or vice versa.
- Fixed time formatting for 12 am and 12 pm.
- Fixed output encoding of the `pybabel --list-locales` command.
- MO files are now written in binary mode on windows (:trac:`61`).


Version 0.9
-----------

(released on August 20th 2007)

- The `new_catalog` distutils command has been renamed to `init_catalog` for
  consistency with the command-line frontend.
- Added compilation of message catalogs to MO files (:trac:`21`).
- Added updating of message catalogs from POT files (:trac:`22`).
- Support for significant digits in number formatting.
- Apply proper "banker's rounding" in number formatting in a cross-platform
  manner.
- The number formatting functions now also work with numbers represented by
  Python `Decimal` objects (:trac:`53`).
- Added extensible infrastructure for validating translation catalogs.
- Fixed the extractor not filtering out messages that didn't validate against
  the keyword's specification (:trac:`39`).
- Fixed the extractor raising an exception when encountering an empty string
  msgid. It now emits a warning to stderr.
- Numerous Python message extractor fixes: it now handles nested function
  calls within a gettext function call correctly, uses the correct line number
  for multi-line function calls, and other small fixes (tickets :trac:`38` and
  :trac:`39`).
- Improved support for detecting Python string formatting fields in message
  strings (:trac:`57`).
- CLDR upgraded to the 1.5 release.
- Improved timezone formatting.
- Implemented scientific number formatting.
- Added mechanism to lookup locales by alias, for cases where browsers insist
  on including only the language code in the `Accept-Language` header, and
  sometimes even the incorrect language code.


Version 0.8.1
-------------

(released on July 2nd 2007)

- `default_locale()` would fail when the value of the `LANGUAGE` environment
  variable contained multiple language codes separated by colon, as is
  explicitly allowed by the GNU gettext tools. As the `default_locale()`
  function is called at the module level in some modules, this bug would
  completely break importing these modules on systems where `LANGUAGE` is set
  that way.
- The character set specified in PO template files is now respected when
  creating new catalog files based on that template. This allows the use of
  characters outside the ASCII range in POT files (:trac:`17`).
- The default ordering of messages in generated POT files, which is based on
  the order those messages are found when walking the source tree, is no
  longer subject to differences between platforms; directory and file names
  are now always sorted alphabetically.
- The Python message extractor now respects the special encoding comment to be
  able to handle files containing non-ASCII characters (:trac:`23`).
- Added ``N_`` (gettext noop) to the extractor's default keywords.
- Made locale string parsing more robust, and also take the script part into
  account (:trac:`27`).
- Added a function to list all locales for which locale data is available.
- Added a command-line option to the `pybabel` command which prints out all
  available locales (:trac:`24`).
- The name of the command-line script has been changed from just `babel` to
  `pybabel` to avoid a conflict with the OpenBabel project (:trac:`34`).


Version 0.8
-----------

(released on June 20th 2007)

- First public release
