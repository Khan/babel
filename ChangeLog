Version 0.9
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/babel/tags/0.9.0/
(?, from branches/stable/0.9.x)

 * Added compilation of message catalogs to MO files.

Version 0.8.1
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/babel/tags/0.8.1/
(?, from branches/stable/0.8.x)

 * `default_locale()` would fail when the value of the `LANGUAGE` environment
   variable contained multiple language codes separated by colon, as is
   explicitly allowed by the GNU gettext tools. As the `default_locale()`
   function is called at the module level in some modules, this bug would
   completely break importing these modules on systems where `LANGUAGE` is set
   that way.
 * The character set specified in PO template files is now respected when
   creating new catalog files based on that template. This allows the use of
   characters outside the ASCII range in POT files (ticket #17).
 * The default ordering of messages in generated POT files, which is based on
   the order those messages are found when walking the source tree, is no
   longer subject to differences between platforms; directory and file names
   are now always sorted alphabetically.
