Version 0.9
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/babel/tags/0.9.0/
(?, from branches/stable/0.9.x)

 * The `new_catalog` distutils command has been renamed to `init_catalog` for
   consistency with the command-line frontend.
 * Added compilation of message catalogs to MO files.
 * Added updating of message catalogs from POT files.
 * Support for significant digits in number formatting.
 * Apply proper "banker's rounding" in number formatting in a cross-platform
   manner.


Version 0.8.1
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/babel/tags/0.8.1/
(Jul 2 2007, from branches/stable/0.8.x)

 * `default_locale()` would fail when the value of the `LANGUAGE` environment
   variable contained multiple language codes separated by colon, as is
   explicitly allowed by the GNU gettext tools. As the `default_locale()`
   function is called at the module level in some modules, this bug would
   completely break importing these modules on systems where `LANGUAGE` is set
   that way.
 * The character set specified in PO template files is now respected when
   creating new catalog files based on that template. This allows the use of
   characters outside the ASCII range in POT files (ticket #17).
 * The default ordering of messages in generated POT files, which is based on
   the order those messages are found when walking the source tree, is no
   longer subject to differences between platforms; directory and file names
   are now always sorted alphabetically.
 * The Python message extractor now respects the special encoding comment to be
   able to handle files containing non-ASCII characters (ticket #23).
 * Added 'N_' (gettext noop) to the extractor's default keywords.
 * Made locale string parsing more robust, and also take the script part into
   account (ticket #27).
 * Added a function to list all locales for which locale data is available.
 * Added a command-line option to the `pybabel` command which prints out all
   available locales (ticket #24).
 * The name of the command-line script has been changed from just `babel` to
   `pybabel` to avoid a conflict with the OpenBabel project (ticket #34).
